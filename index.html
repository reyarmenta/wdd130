        <p>My name is Reynaldo but everyone calls me Rey. I was born in Mexico City but raised in
            Colonia Juarez, a small town in the state of
            Chihuahua. I really like the outdoors, camping, hiking, biking, swiming, exploring and
            ocassionally fishing. I also like to play sports, mainly volleyball, basketball and
            tennis, though I'll pretty much try anything. I served my mission in Brazil, the
            Curitiba Sul mission. </p>
